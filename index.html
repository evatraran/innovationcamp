      <h1 class="border">The Problem</h1>
      <p>
        Statistics from Unicef shows that 29% of pupils in India
        do not complete primary school,
        and often it is those with lower
        income that does not manage to follow through.
        Education is valuable but often other factors
        can get in the way such as hunger,
        bad environment, or that the child needs to
        stay at home to look after their family.
        <br><br>
        In 2015 88,3% was registered in school, most
        of these in public school. However, many of these
        dropped out and in Junior High School the
        attendance is only 44%. It is obligatory
        to take attendance in India,
        but it isnâ€™t always followed through
        and what the real attendance is and the
        causes of the low attendance is uncertain.
        To secure that children in India can keep
        their school attendance we want to make a
        systematic solution that map out the reasons
        for absence.

       <h1 class="border">The Solution </h1>
       <p>Our solution is making an
         app where teachers can digitalize the attendence
         of their students every day. The teachers takes
         the attendence on paper as usual.
         They can then scan the paper with a smart phone
         or scanner. This data is submitted
         into the app which sorts the data and creates a database.
         <br><br>
         This database can be used to identify trends in attendance
         and the reasons behind it.
         In the long run, hopefully the app can also help the school
         identify students that needs
         help to stay in school.
